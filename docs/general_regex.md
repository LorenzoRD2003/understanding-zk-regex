# Regular Expressions
- A `\` followed by a character that is not a newline matches that character. This includes all special characters.
- A caret `^` matches the start of a line.
- A dollar sign `$` matches the end of a line.
- A dot `.` matches any character.
- A single character that has no special meaning matches that character.
- A string enclosed in square brackets `[]` matches any character in the string. ASCII characters can also be abbreviated as `a-z0-9`. If a `^` is the first character inside the brackets, it matches any character that is NOT inside the brackets.
- A regular expression followed by an asterisk `*` matches a sequence of zero or more occurrences of the regular expression.
- A regular expression followed by a plus sign `+` matches a sequence of one or more occurrences of the regular expression.
- A regular expression followed by a question mark `?` matches a sequence of zero or one occurrence of the regular expression.
- Two concatenated regular expressions match an occurrence of the first followed by one of the second.
- Two regular expressions separated by a pipe `|` match an occurrence of the first or the second.
- Parentheses are used to group a regular expression (and then apply special characters as needed).
- Using `@` makes the regular expressions case-sensitive.
- Using `~` makes the regular expressions case-insensitive.
